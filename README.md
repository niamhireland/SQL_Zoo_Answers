# 🐘 SQL Zoo Solutions

## 📘 What is this?

This a collection of my answers to the [SQL Zoo exercises](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial). 
Why did I make it? Well, it's a simple way for me to track what I have done and refer back to previous answers if I need to. 
All the exercises are laid out sequentially and I've added a screenshot of the table for better understanding.
